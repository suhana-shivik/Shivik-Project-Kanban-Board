# Agila

**Agila**

A collaborative **Kanban workspace** for teams: multi-board drag-and-drop, List and Gantt views, real-time collaboration, optional sprint timeboxing with burndown, and an optional **AI Agent** that can assist on tasks, work linked Git repos, or (for admins) run board automations. Built with React/TypeScript, Node.js/Express, and PostgreSQL.

**Quick start (Docker):** `git clone https://github.com/drenlia-inc/agila.git && cd agila && cp docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml && docker compose up --build` — then open http://localhost:3010. Default admin is created on first boot; see [Installation](#installation).

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-board Kanban system** with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Soft WIP limits** on columns (warn when at/over limit; moves still allowed)
- **Card aging** (days in column) and optional **blocked** flag
- **Column policy notes** for short entry/exit guidance
- **Multiple view modes**: Kanban (visual board), List (table format), and Gantt (timeline) views
- **Real-time collaboration** - see changes instantly as team members work
- **User authentication** with local accounts and Google OAuth support
- **Role-based access control** (Admin/User permissions)
- **Theme support** - Light and dark mode

### AI Agent (optional)
- **Assign tasks to an Agent** when an admin enables AI for the instance
- **Assist** — Agent comments on the task using a configured LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, or custom OpenAI-compatible)
- **Code** — Agent works a linked Git repository via the push runner (users add Profile → Dev credentials: API token and/or SSH key)
- **Automation** (admins) — board automation with dry-run review, Apply, and Undo
- **Live activity** on the card (queued / running / waiting) with pause, stop, and resume
- Configure in **Admin → AI Settings** (enable AI, provider, model, runner URL/token). Details: [Documentation.md — AI Agent](/Documentation.md#ai-agent) and [`docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md`](/docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md)

## Getting Started

**Product Owners / Scrum Masters:** after the instance is up, follow the **[Delivery Playbook](docs/DELIVERY_PLAYBOOK.md)** (first-hour setup, board & WIP conventions, rituals, anti-patterns).

1. Log in with the default admin account (see [Installation](#installation))
2. Go to the admin panel and setup:
   1. The site name and URL in Site Settings
   2. In the App Settings, choose the default language (FR/EN)
   3. Review the Project Settings (and **Features** for board indicators / effort / overdue)
   4. Add sprints in the Sprint Settings
   5. Review Reports Settings
3. Create team members in the Users Tab
4. Go to Kanban View and set up your boards and columns
5. Start creating and managing tasks
6. Configure Google OAuth (optional) in Admin > SSO settings
7. Configure AI Agent (optional) in Admin > AI Settings — for coding jobs, users then add Profile → Dev credentials

## Requirements

- Node.js v20.18+

## Installation

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drenlia-inc/agila.git
cd agila
cp docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up --build
```

(`npm run docker:dev` is the same command: `docker compose up --build`.)

Before the first production run, edit `docker-compose.yml`:
- `JWT_SECRET`: strong secret for authentication
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: your domain(s), e.g. `yourdomain.com`
- `DEMO_ENABLED`: `false` for a real instance; `true` only for a generated demo dataset
- Optional AI runner (Agent **Code** jobs): `AI_RUNNER_URL`, `AI_CALLBACK_BASE_URL`, `RUNNER_TOKEN`

**Access:** frontend http://localhost:3010 · API http://localhost:3222

More detail: [DOCKER.md](/DOCKER.md)

### Default admin (first boot)

On a **new empty database**, Agila creates `admin@kanban.local` with a **random password** and prints it **once** in the app container logs:

```text
Email: admin@kanban.local
Password: <generated>
```

Follow the logs with `docker compose logs -f agila`.

- **`DEMO_ENABLED=true`:** the login page also shows this password (and a one-click sign-in on the public demo).
- **`DEMO_ENABLED=false`:** the password is **not** shown on the login page — only in those first-boot logs.
- Later restarts **do not** print the password again. If you lose it, reset it from another admin account; it will not reappear in logs.

## Database Backup & Restore

**Breaking change:** Agila is **PostgreSQL-only**. SQLite (`kanban.db`) is no longer supported. All Docker editions (free, demo, basic, pro) run Postgres + Redis. Existing SQLite data must be migrated out-of-band or you must start with a fresh Postgres volume.

### Automated Backup Script

```bash
# Create a timestamped pg_dump (gzipped) under ./backups
./scripts/backup-postgres.sh

# Restore latest (or pass a specific .sql.gz)
./scripts/restore-postgres.sh
./scripts/restore-postgres.sh ./backups/kanban-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz
```

**Features:**
- Timestamped dumps (`kanban-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz`)
- Keeps the last 10 dumps
- Latest symlink (`kanban-latest.sql.gz`)

### Manual Backup

```bash
docker exec agila-postgres pg_dump -U kanban_user -d kanban --clean --if-exists \
  | gzip > ./backups/kanban-manual.sql.gz
```

### Restore Database

```bash
gunzip -c ./backups/kanban-latest.sql.gz \
  | docker exec -i agila-postgres psql -U kanban_user -d kanban
```

**Important:** Prefer restoring while the app is stopped or briefly unavailable to avoid concurrent writes during restore.

## Security

The application includes JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. For production deployments:

- Change the default admin password immediately
- Set a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production
- Keep `DEMO_ENABLED=false` (demo compose is the exception)
- Do not set `ALLOW_TEST_ENDPOINTS` on real production hosts
- Configure HTTPS/TLS at the reverse proxy
- Attachments/avatars use an HttpOnly media cookie (not the session JWT in `?token=`)
- Review **Admin → Troubleshooting → CSP reports** before enforcing Content-Security-Policy
- Consider additional network security measures
