/**
 * SQL Manager - Centralized Query Management
 * 
 * This module provides centralized PostgreSQL-native queries organized by domain.
 * All queries use PostgreSQL syntax ($1, $2, $3 placeholders, json_agg, etc.)
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   import { tasks } from '../utils/sqlManager/index.js';
 *   const task = await tasks.getTaskById(db, taskId);
