## Application Overview

Agila is a comprehensive agile project management platform that combines Kanban boards, Gantt charts, and list views for complete project visibility. It features real-time collaboration, advanced task management, and team coordination tools.

**Platform:** PostgreSQL-backed (single-tenant Docker or multi-tenant Kubernetes). Real-time updates use PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY` with Socket.IO (Redis adapter for multi-pod deployments).

### Key Features
- **Multi-board Kanban system** with drag-and-drop (including cross-board drops)
- **Soft WIP limits** (column and board), card aging, blocked flags, and column policy notes
- **Multiple views**: Kanban, List, and Gantt
- **Real-time collaboration** - see changes instantly as team members work
- **User authentication** with local accounts and Google OAuth support
- **Role-based access control** (Admin/User permissions)
- **Team management** with color-coded member assignments
- **Task management** with priorities, comments, attachments, and relationships
- **Multi-select & bulk actions** - tag, copy, sprint, priority, archive, delete, move board; multi-drag between columns
- **Soft delete & trash** - restore or permanently purge tasks and boards (board trash + Admin → Lifecycle); admins can Shift+click delete to purge without trash
- **AI Agent** (optional) — assign tasks to an Agent that can comment (**Assist**), work a linked Git repo (**Code**), or (admins) run board **Automation** with dry-run Apply/Undo (see [AI Agent](#ai-agent))
- **Admin panel** for users, branding, mail, SSO, sprints, reporting, licensing, and lifecycle
- **File uploads** for task attachments and user avatars
- **Site branding** - custom logo (light/dark), optional hide logo / GitHub link
- **EN / FR localization**

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full access to all features including user management and system configuration
- **User**: Access to boards, tasks, and collaboration features (no admin privileges)

---

## Getting Started

**New team leads (PO / Scrum Master):** after install, use the [Delivery Playbook](docs/DELIVERY_PLAYBOOK.md) for a first-hour setup, board/WIP conventions, rituals, and anti-patterns. This section remains the product reference for auth and initial admin setup.

### Authentication & Demo Mode

#### Demo Mode (Recommended for Testing)
When running in **demo mode** (`DEMO_ENABLED=true`), the application seeds an admin account and sample team members with randomly generated passwords:

**Admin Account:**
- **Email**: `admin@kanban.local`
- **Password**: Randomly generated (shown on the login page; copy/fill from there)

**Sample team accounts** (created with the demo board data):
- `john.smith@demo.local`
- `sarah.johnson@demo.local`
- `mike.davis@demo.local`

Passwords for sample users are stored as `DEMO_PASSWORD_<email>` settings (not shown on the login page by default). The login page surfaces the admin credentials when demo mode is enabled.

#### Production Mode
In production mode, you'll need to create your own user accounts through the admin panel after initial setup.

### Initial Setup
1. **Demo Mode**: Use the admin credentials displayed on the login page
2. **Production Mode**: Create your first admin account through the setup process
3. Create team members in the Admin panel
4. Set up your boards and columns
5. Start creating and managing tasks
6. Configure Google OAuth (optional) in Admin > SSO settings
7. Configure branding (optional) in Admin > Site Settings (logo, site name)
8. Configure AI Agent (optional) in Admin > AI Settings — then users add Profile → Dev credentials for coding jobs

---

## Header & Navigation

[Screenshot: Header with all buttons visible]

The sticky header contains branding, sprint context, app navigation, and utilities.

### Left Side
- **Site brand**: Logo and/or site name (from Admin → Site Settings). Click to follow the configured site URL.
  - Default logo is `/agila-logo.png` when no custom logo is set
  - Empty site name hides the text (no fallback to a default product name)
  - **Hide Site Logo** (admin setting) removes the logo entirely
- **Sprint selector** (Kanban page): Filter by sprint or backlog
- **Demo countdown** (when demo mode is enabled)

### Right Side (left → right)

1. **App navigation**: Kanban · Reports (if enabled) · Admin (admins)
2. **Invite** (admins): Invite a user by email
3. **Preferences**: Theme (light/dark) · Language (EN/FR)
4. **Utilities**: Refresh · System panel toggle (admins) · Help (F1 or ?)
5. **GitHub** link (opens in a new tab; can be hidden in Site Settings)
6. **User avatar** (always last): Profile · Logout

---

## Tools Panel

The **Tools** card on the Kanban page controls board layout and card density.

- **Board view** (dropdown): Kanban · List · Gantt — same icon size as the toolbar button; short labels in the menu, full description on hover
- **Search**: Toggle advanced search/filters
- **Card density** (dropdown): Full · Preview · Minimal
  - **Compact** (tickets only) hides descriptions on cards and shows a **red dot** on the density button as a reminder

---

## AI Agent

Optional feature. Requires an administrator to enable AI and configure an LLM (and usually an agent runner for coding jobs).

### What it does
- Adds an **Agent** assignee (system member — not a licensed login seat)
- Lets you **queue work** on a task: coding against a Git repo, **assist** (comment-oriented, no repo), or **Automation** (admins — board-wide tool ops with preview)
- Shows **live progress** on the card and in an activity screen (logs, pause / stop / resume)
- For coding jobs, can commit, push a branch, and open a **pull request** when GitHub credentials allow
- For Automation: dry-run plan → admin **Apply** → optional **Undo**; copy the task to reuse the recipe, or edit and Re-run

### Assigning work
1. Ensure the task has a **description** (required before the Agent can be queued)
2. Open **Assign to Agent** from the task card toolbar (or assignee flow when AI is on)
3. Choose:
   - **Assist** — no repository
   - **Code** — repository URL + optional branch
   - **Automation** (admins) — scope: this board / selected boards / all boards
   - Optional model override (admins) when allowed
4. Confirm — the task is assigned to the Agent and status becomes **queued**, then **running** when a runner slot is available
5. For Automation, review the dry-run on the activity screen and click **Apply** before changes run

### Controlling a running job
- Open the **Agent activity** screen from the card
- **Pause** / **Stop** — requests the runner to cancel; status updates on the card
- **Resume** / **Re-run** — re-queues work after pause, wait, stop, or failure (as allowed by status)
- **Apply** / **Undo** (Automation, admins) — execute or reverse the dry-run plan
- While the Agent is actively working, dragging the card may be blocked

### Waiting for your reply
- The Agent may post a comment and enter a **waiting** state
- Reply in comments, then **resume** when you want work to continue
- Automation waiting for Apply is a separate admin confirmation step (not a comment reply)

### Prerequisites checklist
| Who | Need |
|-----|------|
| Admin | AI enabled; LLM provider/key/model; runner URL/token for coding/automation jobs |
| Admin (automation) | Use Automation mode; review dry-run; Apply/Undo |
| User (coding) | Profile → Dev: GitHub PAT and/or SSH key with access to the repo |
| User (assist) | AI enabled; no Git credentials required |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### WebSocket Connection Problems
- **Symptoms**: No real-time updates, manual refresh needed
- **Solution**: Use the refresh button to force data sync
- **Prevention**: Check internet connection and browser compatibility; in multi-pod K8s, ensure Redis is healthy for the Socket.IO adapter

#### Task Not Updating on the Board
- **Symptoms**: Side-panel edits save but the card looks unchanged
- **Solution**: Confirm you are not in **compact** card density (red dot on Tools); switch to expand/shrink to see descriptions. Use refresh if the WebSocket disconnected
- **Prevention**: Keep Tools density on expand/shrink when reviewing descriptions

#### Permission Errors
- **Symptoms**: Cannot perform certain actions
- **Solution**: Check user role and permissions
- **Prevention**: Ensure proper user role assignment

#### Performance Test Overlay (admin troubleshooting)
- **Enable**: Admin → App Settings → Troubleshooting → **Performance Test Overlay** (type `TROUBLE` first on multi-tenant/demo). Saves to **your** `user_settings.FE_PERF_TESTS` via `PUT /api/user/settings`
- **Use**:
  - **Kanban**: floating **PERF TESTS** — Burst create, Move storm, Cleanup, reports
  - **Admin**: floating **PERF TESTS · ADMIN** — seed users (`perf.user…@local`, active, no invite), tags (`perf-tag-…`), sprints (`Perf Sprint …`), Seed all, Cleanup seed
- **Disable**: Turn the same toggle off when finished; other admins never see the overlay from your preference
- **Multi-user load**: Each participating admin enables the overlay on their own account; each tab runs its own client-driven scenarios

#### CSP reports (security hardening)
- **Where**: Admin → App Settings → Troubleshooting → **CSP reports**
- **What**: Browser Content-Security-Policy (Report-Only) violations collected at `POST /api/csp-report` and stored per tenant
- **Use**: Review the list after normal usage; Clear when done. Keep CSP Report-Only until the list stays quiet, then enforce
- **Details**: See `DEBUGGING.md` (CSP reports section) and `audit/security-assessment-current-2026-08.md` (S4)

#### Performance Issues
- **Symptoms**: Slow loading, laggy interface
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache, check internet connection
- **Prevention**: Regular browser maintenance, stable internet

#### AI Agent / runner problems
- **Symptoms**: Assign to Agent fails, job stays queued, or coding jobs fail immediately
- **Checks**:
  - Admin → AI Settings: AI enabled; **Validate** LLM; **Probe** runner (for coding jobs)
  - Task has a non-empty description
  - Coding jobs: Profile → Dev has a GitHub PAT and/or SSH key; use **Repo check** for the URL
  - Assist jobs do not need a runner for LLM chat alone in the same way as coding — if coding is intended, confirm runner URL/token and that `AI_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` / networking allows the runner to reach the app (Docker/K8s)
- **Developer reference**: [`docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md)

### Getting Help
- **Help Modal**: Press F1 or ? (or click help button)
